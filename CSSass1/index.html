    <h2 class="green">What is CSS ?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="margin">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <li class="margin">CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li>
        <li class="margin"><span class="linethrough">CSS is not necessary</span>
            <span class="highlighted bold"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>
            It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        </li>
        <li class="underline ">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="red">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
            however,
    <span class="highlighted"> in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span>
            because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="big">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a
        style to multiple elements.ID,
        on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.
        ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </h3>
    <p class=" smallfontsize">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a
        webpage.
        Once an element has been targeted,
        a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

    <p class="last">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class
        and ID.
        Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
